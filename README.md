# Healthcare-Data-Analytics-Dashboard
A Power BI project analyzing healthcare KPIs and patient data to provide actionable insights.

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Healthcare providers often face challenges in consolidating patient encounters, financial data, and payer information into one view. This project was designed to create an **interactive Power BI dashboard** using **Excel/CSV datasets** that provides insights into patient encounters, revenue distribution, payer performance, and demographic statistics.  

## ðŸ›  Tools Used  
- **Excel/CSV** â†’ For raw data source  
- **Power BI** â†’ For data modeling, dashboard design, and visualization  

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Taken  
1. Imported healthcare datasets (patient, encounter, payer, and financial data) from CSV/Excel files into Power BI.  
2. Cleaned and transformed the datasets in **Power Query** (handled missing values, standardized formats, and removed duplicates).  
3. Built relationships between patients, encounters, payers, and procedures in Power BIâ€™s **data model**.  
4. Designed KPIs and created interactive reports with slicers and drill-through functionality.  
5. Organized the dashboard into three main views:  
   - **Patient & Encounter Overview**  
   - **Financial & Payer Insights**  
   - **Patient Demographics**  

## ðŸ“Š Results & Insights  
- **Patient Encounters** â†’ 28K encounters from 974 unique patients with 48K recorded procedures.  
- **Encounter Trends** â†’ Ambulatory visits had the highest volume (12.5K), while inpatient visits were lowest (1.1K).  
- **Revenue Insights** â†’ Total revenue was **$101.51M**, with Blue Horizon contributing the highest share ($21.7M).  
- **Payer Analysis** â†’ 10 payers tracked, with patient distribution and revenue breakdowns by payer.  
- **Demographics** â†’ Gender distribution was nearly balanced (494M vs 480F), and age group analysis showed higher encounter volume in patients aged 65+.
